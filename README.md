# Seating_Chart
I made this project for my high school French teacher when I learned that she printed a class list and class layout and then wrote students' names on the layout for each of her classes every single time she wanted a seating change (it was a lot of tedious work, I did it once)! She didn't like the seating chart generator provided by PowerSchool which she had access to so I wrote this little project to take a class list (in the format she had) and generate a seating chart specifically for her classroom and then both display that chart as well as create a text file with the chart that could be easily printed.
